# OWASP API Security Testing Framework

## Description

The OWASP API Security Testing Framework (ASTF) is a specialized security testing tool designed to identify vulnerabilities in APIs based on the OWASP API Security Top 10. In an era where APIs form the backbone of modern applications, this framework enables automated security validation, making it easier to integrate security testing into development pipelines.

## Project Purpose

Modern applications rely heavily on APIs, but specialized tools for testing API security are lacking. The ASTF fills this gap by providing:

1. Automated detection of API-specific vulnerabilities
2. Integration capabilities with CI/CD pipelines
3. Comprehensive security reporting
4. Support for multiple API architectures (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Pre-built test cases covering all OWASP API Security Top 10 vulnerabilities
- **Flexible Architecture**: Support for different API types and authentication mechanisms
- **CI/CD Integration**: Native integrations with popular CI/CD platforms
- **Customizable Rules**: Ability to create custom test cases beyond the default set
- **Detailed Reporting**: Comprehensive vulnerability reports with remediation guidance
- **Real-world Attack Patterns**: Incorporates patterns observed in actual API breaches

## Getting Involved

The API Security Testing Framework welcomes contributions from the community. Here's how you can get involved:

- **Code Contributions**: Help develop new test cases or improve existing ones
- **Documentation**: Assist with improving guides and examples
- **Testing**: Try the framework on your APIs and provide feedback
- **Use Cases**: Share your API security testing scenarios
